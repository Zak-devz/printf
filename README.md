Project: Creating a Duplicate of Printf in C

Overview:
In this project, the goal is to create a duplicate of the printf function in the C programming language. Printf is a powerful and widely used function that allows programmers to format and print output to the console. By creating a duplicate of this function, we can improve our understanding of C programming and gain experience with fundamental programming concepts such as function definition, parameter passing, string manipulation, and error handling.
